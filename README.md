# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you canâ€™t go back!**

If you arenâ€™t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point youâ€™re on your own.

You donâ€™t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldnâ€™t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldnâ€™t be useful if you couldnâ€™t customize it when you are ready for it.

# Farm Management React App - Developer Readme

Welcome, developer! We're excited to have you work on building the Farm Management React App(la_ferme). This application aims to provide a simple solution for managing salary payments to workers and recording daily milk production on the farm. The app will be written in TypeScript, and we will be using local arrays to simulate a database.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin working on the project, please ensure you have the following installed on your development machine:

1. Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) - Visit https://nodejs.org/ to download and install Node.js.

## Getting Started

To start developing the Farm Management React App, follow the steps below:

1. Fork the repository: Start by forking this repository to your GitHub account.

2. Clone the repository: Use the following command to clone the forked repository to your local machine:

```bash
[git clone https://github.com/your-username/farm-management-react-app.git](https://github.com/UsanaseD/la_ferme.git)
```

3. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd la_ferme
```

4. Install dependencies: Use npm to install the required dependencies for the project.

```bash
npm install
```

## Project Structure

The project structure should look like this:

```
la_ferme/
la_ferme
  â”œâ”€â”€ src/
  â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ assets/
  â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ la ferme.png
  â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/
  â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ SalaryPaymentForm.tsx
  â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ SalaryPaymentTable.tsx
  â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ DailyMilkProductionForm.tsx
  â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€  DailyMilkProductionTable.tsx
  â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
  â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ types/
  â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ WorkerType.ts
  â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ MilkProductionType.ts
  â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ utils/
  â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ database.ts
  â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ App.tsx
  â”‚   â””â”€â”€ index.tsx
  â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
  â”œâ”€â”€ tsconfig.json
  â”œâ”€â”€ .gitignore
  â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
  â””â”€â”€ ...
```

## Features

The Farm Management React App should have two main features:

### 1. Salary Payment Management

This feature will allow users to record salary payments to workers. Each payment should include the following information:

- Worker's name
- Salary amount paid
- Time recorded for the payment
- Type of worker (casual or monthly paid)
- Time of balance to be paid (if applicable)

Please create the necessary components and forms to add and display salary payment information.

### 2. Daily Milk Production

This feature will allow users to record daily milk production on the farm. Each entry should include the following information:

- Date of milk production
- Quantity of milk produced
- Additional details (if necessary)

Create the necessary components and forms to add and display milk production information.

## Data Storage

As mentioned earlier, we will use local arrays to act as a database. You can find a utility file `database.ts` inside the `utils` directory. Use this file to define and manage the arrays for storing salary payment and milk production data.

## Bonus

As a bonus you can add login form for users to get into their acounts

## TypeScript

Ensure that the entire project is written in TypeScript. Utilize type definitions to maintain type safety throughout the application.

## Development and Testing

During development, you are encouraged to use meaningful git commit messages and branch names to keep track of your work.

Once you have completed implementing the features, please test the application thoroughly to ensure it is functioning as expected. You may also write unit tests to cover critical functionality.

## Submission

Once you have completed the project, push your changes to your forked repository on GitHub. Then, create a pull request to the original repository. Include any relevant notes or instructions in the pull request description.

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or need clarifications on the requirements. Good luck, and happy coding! ðŸš€
